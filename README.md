# Glowkit
Glowkit is a fork of the legendary [Bukkit API](https://bukkit.org), 
as continued by [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org), intended for use with Glowstone.

Plugins designed for the original Bukkit API will continue to run on Glowstone, with zero or minimal changes.

The Glowkit Javadocs are available [here](http://www.nox2.net/glowkit).
