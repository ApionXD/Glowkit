# Glowkit
Glowkit is a fork of the legendary [Bukkit API](https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit)
intended for use with Glowstone. It is not a true successor, but instead includes
some updates and additions to the Bukkit API which are useful to Glowstone.
For a spiritual successor to the Bukkit API, see [Sponge](https://github.com/SpongePowered).

Plugins designed for the original Bukkit API will continue to run on Glowstone,
and and are likely to build against Glowkit with zero or minimal changes.
